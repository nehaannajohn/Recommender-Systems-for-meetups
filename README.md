# Recommender-Systems-for-meetups
This is a recommender system based on meetups. We have utilized information on members, groups and rsvps to recommend similar such groups to the users. Both user based and item based collaborative filtering has been utilized. In order to find similarity between users/groups, I have used two different similarity metrics: cosine similarity and pearson correlation.
